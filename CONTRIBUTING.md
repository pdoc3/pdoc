Contributing guidelines
=======================

Issues
------
Only report issues for **PyPI package _pdoc3_**.
If your issue pertains to the other PyPI package _pdoc_,
report its issue [here](https://github.com/mitmproxy/pdoc).

Before reporting an issue, please see if a similar issue is already open.
If applicable, also check if a similar issue has recently been closed
â€” your bug might have been just fixed.

To have your issue dealt with promptly, it's best to construct a
[minimal working example] that exposes the issue in a clear and
reproducible manner.
