Contributing guidelines
=======================

Issues
------
**Only report issues for _pdoc3_ package on PyPI.**
If your issue pertains to older _pdoc_ package (on PyPI),
report the issue [here] or ... just stop using it.

[here]: https://github.com/mitmproxy/pdoc

Before reporting an issue, see if a similar issue is already open.
Also check if a similar issue was recently closed â€” your bug might
have been fixed already.

To have your issue dealt with promptly, it's best to construct a
[minimal working example] that exposes the issue in a clear and
reproducible manner.
